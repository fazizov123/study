Passwordless connection between W and L
W:    Ctrl+R --> cmd --> command prompt
W:    ssh-keygen -t rsa --> skip everything with Enter - generate keygen for Windows
L:    mkdir -p ~/.ssh - create .ssh directory (you probably have this so skip this step)
W:    scp C:\Users\adam\.ssh\id_rsa.pub root@centos-server-ip:~/.ssh/ - copy pubkey to centos
L:    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys - add key from windows to authorized keys in centos machine
L:    systemctl restart sshd - restart ssh deamon
